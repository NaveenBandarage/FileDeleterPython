A a simple script that deletes screenshots for me nothing more nothing less. When taking notes from lectures or just screenshots in general. They start to pile up over time and it becomes a pain to delete them (doesn't really take that long tbh). But nevertheless its time that could be saved through automation. Hence why this script was born.
